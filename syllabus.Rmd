# Overview and Class Goals

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

This course continues the graduate sequence in quantitative political methodology, focused particularly on fitting, interpreting, and refining the linear regression model.

Our agenda includes gaining familiarity with statistical programming via the popular R environment, developing clear and informative graphical representations of regression results, and understanding regression models in matrix form.

<!-- End from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

# Prerequisites

<!-- Begin from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

It is desirable for students to have taken the introductory course in the
sequence (Political Science 501), but any prior course on basic social statistics and linear regression should suffice.

<!-- End from Chris Adolph syllabus -->

# Assessment and Evaluation

## Problem Sets

Problem sets assigned weekly or bi-weekly. These problem sets will include programming problems with an emphasis on writing understandable, reproducible code.

The assignments and due dates will be distributed during the semester
<!-- These assignments may involve peer review / grading. -->

Assignments will be *both* submitted digitally through Canvas at the due date and a paper copy to the TA at the next lab section.

## Final Paper

A 15--20 page original report on an original quantitative analysis or replication-and-extension of a published article.
The quantitative analysis should be conducted in R and reproducible.
Students may work in pairs on the final paper with instructor permission.

The final paper is due on **June 9, 2015 15:00 PDT**.

For details, see the [Guidelines for the Final Papers](posts/final-papers.html).

## Email & Canvas: 

The teaching team will send announcements regularly by email.

Any non-personal questions related to the material in the course should be posted as a Canvas discussion.
Reserve email for personal or administrative matters.
Before posting, check that the question has not been asked and answered already.

It is often more efficient to answer questions in person, so try to ask them attend office hours.

## Resources

There are a couple places on campus that you can go to get additional statistical conulting

- CSSCR has a drop-in statistical consulting center in Savery 119. They provide consulting on statistical software, e.g. R. http://csscr.washington.edu/consulting.html
- CSSS Statistical Consulting provides general statistical consulting (questions about your research project).
  You can find their hours and locations on thier [site](https://www.csss.washington.edu/Consulting/).
