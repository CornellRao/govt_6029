**Due via Blackboard**: Fri, Feb 23 

**Due via GitHub**: Mon, Feb 26 

## Instructions

- Create a new R markdown called `hw1_lastname` (where `lastname` should be your actual last name of course.
- Do all your analyses in the R markdown document.
- Compile an html document
- Submit only the R markdown through Blackboard. This should contain all necessary code and materials for another person to run your R Markdown file.
- Upload to GitHub, on Monday - Feb 26, both the .html and the .Rmarkdown files

Some other guidance

- All problems should be answerable in *at most* a few lines of R code.
  Questions which require looking up values should be answered using R code and not manually checking the value through the RStudio GUI.
- Problems are thematically divided but each bullet point should be seen as a separate exercise  
  

## Data

The file [democracy.csv](https://github.com/GarciaRios/govt_6029/raw/master/data/democracy.csv) contains data from Przeworski et. al, *Demoracy and Deveolpment: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the Worlds, 1950-1990*<sup>1</sup>.
The data have been slightly recoded, to make higher values indicate higher levels of political liberty and democracy.

| Variable | Description |
|:---|:--------------------------------------|
| `COUNTRY` | numerical code for each country |
| `CTYNAME` | name of each country |
| `REGION` | name of region containing country |
| `YEAR` | year of observation |
| `GDPW`   |  GDP per capita in real international prices |
| `EDT`    |  average years of education |
| `ELF60`  |  ethnolinguistic fractionalization |
| `MOSLEM` |  percentage of Muslims in country |
| `CATH`   |  percentage of Catholics in country |
| `OIL`    |  whether oil accounts for 50+\% of exports |
| `STRA`   |  count of recent regime transitions |
| `NEWC`   |  whether county was created after 1945 |
| `BRITCOL` |  whether country was a British colony |
| `POLLIB` | degree of political liberty (1--7 scale, rising in political liberty) |
| `CIVLIB` | degree of civil liberties (1--7 scale, rising in civil liberties) |
| `REG`    | presence of democracy (0=non-democracy, 1=democracy)|



## Problems

a. **Initial set up**
   - Load the Democracy dataset into memory as a dataframe. Use the
   `read.csv` function, and the `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`
   option. Note that missing values are indicated by "`.`" in the
   data. Find the option in `read.csv` that controls the string used
   to indicate missing values.

b. **Initial data exploration** 
   - Report summary statistics (means and medians, at least) for all variables.
   - Create a histogram for political liberties in which each unique value of the variable is in its own bin.
   - Create a histogram for GDP per capita.
   - Create a histogram for **log** GDP per-capita. How is this histogram different than the one for GDP per capita when it was not logged.

c. **Explore relationships** 
   - Create a scatterplot of political liberties against GDP per capita.
   - When there is a lot of overlap in a scatter plot it is useful to
   "jitter" the points (randomly move them up and down).  Make the
   previous plot but jitter the points to mitigate the problem of
   overplotting. (Only jitter the points vertically). You can use
   `geom_jitter` in **ggplot2** for this.
   - Create a scatterplot of political liberties against **log** GDP per
   capita. Jitter the points.  How is the relationship different than
   when GDP per capita was not logged.
   - Create a boxplot of GDP per capita for oil producing and non-oil producing nations.

d. **Transform data and analyse**
   - Calculate the mean GDP per capita in countries with at least 40 percent Catholics.
   How does it compare to mean GDP per capita for all countries?
   - Calculate the average GDP per capita in countries with greater than
   60% ethnolinguistic fractionalization, less than 60%, and missing
   ethnolinguistic fractionalization.  Hint: you can calculate this
   with the **dplyr** verbs: `filter`,`mutate`, `group_by` and/or `summarise`. Like everything else there are multiple ways to do this; some more simple (require only one or two verbs)  other more complex where you might need to combine multiple verbs and perhaps might need to do some googling. 
   - What was the median of the average years of education in 1985 for
all countries?
   - Which country was (or countries were) closest to the median years of education in 1985 among all countries?
   - What was the median of the average years of education in 1985 for democracies?
   - Which democracy was (or democracies were) closest to the median years of education in 1985 among all democracies?
   - What were the 25th and 75th percentiles of ethnolinguistic fractionalization for new and old countries?
